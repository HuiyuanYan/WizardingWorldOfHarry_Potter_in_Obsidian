# Introduction
Fawkes was a highly intelligent male phoenix and Albus Dumbledore's animal companion and defender. Fawkes had been in Dumbledore's service for 59 years up to the Headmaster's death in 1997.

Fawkes was instrumental in helping Harry Potter defeat Salazar Slytherin's Basilisk in 1993. His tears (which possessed healing properties, as with his species) saved Harry's life after his arm was punctured by the basilisk's fang and its venom. In 1996, Fawkes came to Dumbledore's aid in fighting Lord Voldemort during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries.

Following Dumbledore's death, Fawkes sang his Lament over the grounds of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and then left and flew away, never to be seen again.

His tail feathers were the cores of the two twin wands which were held by Lord Voldemort and Harry Potter.
