# Introduction
Madam Rolanda Hooch (b. before 1918) was a witch who worked as the Flying instructor, Quidditch referee, and coach at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. She learnt to fly on her own Silver Arrow broomstick sometime before or during the Great War and returned to Hogwarts, which was her childhood school, for a job. While on staff at Hogwarts, Hooch worked under Headmasters Albus Dumbledore, Dolores Umbridge, and Minerva McGonagall.

During her years of employment at Hogwarts, she taught students how to successfully fly broomsticks (such as the famous Harry Potter), and also acted as the official referee for Quidditch games held at Hogwarts. Her profession also included other important duties, such as keeping students safe from harm whilst they trained for Quidditch, and checking the brooms of students to make sure they were not bewitched with dark charms.

Hooch also survived the Second Wizarding War, and returned to her post as Flying Instructor and Quidditch referee after 1998.
