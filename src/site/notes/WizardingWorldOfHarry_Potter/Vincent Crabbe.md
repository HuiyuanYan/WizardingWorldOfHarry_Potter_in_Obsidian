# Introduction
Vincent Crabbe (c. 1980 â€“ 2 May 1998) was a pure-blood wizard, and the son of Death Eater Crabbe Snr. He came from a line of Dark wizards and Death Eaters, with his father and possibly grandfather before him.

Vincent Crabbe was also a student at Hogwarts and a member of Slytherin House. Crabbe and Gregory Goyle were rarely seen without their ringleader Draco Malfoy. While Dolores Umbridge was Headmistress, he joined the Inquisitorial Squad with Goyle and Malfoy. 

In his last year at Hogwarts, he became a Dark wizard. He learned to cast powerful Dark curses, such as the Killing and the Cruciatus Curses. During the Battle of Hogwarts, he accidentally killed himself using Fiendfyre in the Room of Requirement.
