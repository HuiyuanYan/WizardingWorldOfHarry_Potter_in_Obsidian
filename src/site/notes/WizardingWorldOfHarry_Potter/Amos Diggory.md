# Introduction
Amos Diggory was a British wizard who worked for the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures in the British Ministry of Magic. He and his wife lost their son Cedric on 24 June 1995 during the last and third task in the Triwizard Tournament, when he was murdered by Peter Pettigrew on Lord Voldemort's orders.

After the events of the Second Wizarding War, Amos still had not made peace with the death of his son. In 2020, he sought a meeting with Harry Potter, in the hopes of saving his deceased son via a new time-turner that was discovered.
