# Introduction
William Arthur "Bill" Weasley (b. 29 November 1970) was an English pure-blood wizard, the first child of Arthur and Molly Weasley (n√©e Prewett) and the eldest brother of Charlie, Percy, the late Fred, George, Ron, and Ginny. He attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry from 1982 to 1989 and was Sorted into Gryffindor House. Bill was both a Prefect and Head Boy. 

After graduating from Hogwarts he went to work for Gringotts Wizarding Bank as a Curse-Breaker, working in Egypt. In 1995, he returned to England and joined the reconstituted Order of the Phoenix to face the reborn Lord Voldemort. During this time, he started courting Fleur Delacour and eventually proposed to her after a year of dating.

During the Battle of the Astronomy Tower, Bill was severely injured and scarred by the werewolf Fenrir Greyback. Although he wasn't turned into a werewolf, he did develop some wolfish tendencies such as a liking for very rare steaks. He married Fleur on 1 August 1997, although their wedding was disrupted by the arrival of Death Eaters following the fall of the Ministry of Magic. 

Bill and Fleur then moved to Shell Cottage, where they assisted Harry, Ron, and Hermione after their escape from Malfoy Manor. Bill later fought in the Battle of Hogwarts alongside the rest of the Order and survived.

Following the war, Bill and Fleur had three children: Victoire, Dominique, and Louis Weasley. Bill also had several nieces and nephews.
