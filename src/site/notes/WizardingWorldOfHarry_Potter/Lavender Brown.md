# Introduction
Lavender Brown (c. 1980 â€“ 2 May 1998) was a pure-blood witch, the daughter of Mr and Mrs Brown, and sorted into Gryffindor. She started her education at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in 1991, the same year as the famous Harry Potter.

While at Hogwarts Lavender began studying Divination, which she was fascinated by. In her fifth year she joined Dumbledore's Army, an organisation taught and led by Harry Potter that sought to combat the Death Eaters, despite Lavender initially doubting Harry's claims that Lord Voldemort had returned. The following year she started a relationship with Ron Weasley, though they soon broke up.

In her final year of schooling Lavender joined the reconstituted D.A. to oppose Death Eater control of Hogwarts and fought in the Battle of Hogwarts. During the battle she was savaged by werewolf Fenrir Greyback and died of her injuries.
