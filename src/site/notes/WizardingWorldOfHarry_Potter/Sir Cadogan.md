![Sir Cadogan](http://rxbg5ysja.bkt.gdipper.com/Sir_Cadogan.png)
# Introduction
Sir Cadogan was a wizard and sworn Knight of the Round Table, albeit not a very well known one, being only included in wizarding versions of the tales of King Arthur. He is most famous for his defeat of the Wyvern of Wye at great personal risk. Sometime after his death, he was immortalised with a portrait at the end of the Divination corridor in Hogwarts Castle, which displayed the same "insane bravery" as Cadogan did in life.
