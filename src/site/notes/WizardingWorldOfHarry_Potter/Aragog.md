# Introduction
Aragog (c. 1942 â€“ 20 April 1997) was an Acromantula owned by Rubeus Hagrid. Like the rest of his species, Aragog had a taste for human flesh and was able to communicate with humans with speech. In his youth, he was the size of a Pekingese and near the end of his life was about the size of a small elephant with an eighteen-foot leg span.

Aragog had a wife, Mosag, and was the leader of a large Acromantula colony composed of all of his sons and daughters. During his life, Aragog was accused of being Slytherin's Monster, although the monster was really a Basilisk. Ironically, all spiders feared the Basilisk, as it was their mortal enemy. After Aragog died, some of his venom was taken by Horace Slughorn and was most likely stored in Horace's potion cabinet.
