# Introduction
Professor Cuthbert Binns (d. pre-1890) was a wizard and History of Magic professor at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He owned an office in the main castle and Classroom 4F on the first floor to teach in. He taught until a very old age, when he fell asleep in the staff room and died in slumber. Afterwards, he became a ghost who continued to teach, droning on about various Goblin Rebellions and giant wars to bored, sleeping students.

Professor Binns's lessons were regarded as some of the most boring at Hogwarts, and only once in known history did he talk about something not strictly factual. During the 1991â€“1992 school year, he taught his first-year students about numerous historical personalities such as Uric the Oddball and Emeric the Evil, whom the class always confused with each other.

The following academic year, he relayed the legend of the Chamber of Secrets to his second-year class, but only after every student in the class showed complete and utter interest, despite initially stating the legend of the Chamber to be unimportant. He continued to teach Harry Potter and his class for three further years, until most, if not every one of his students dropped History of Magic after completing their Ordinary Wizarding Levels.
