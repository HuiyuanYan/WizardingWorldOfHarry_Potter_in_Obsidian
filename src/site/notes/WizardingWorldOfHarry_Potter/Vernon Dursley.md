![Vernon Dursley](http://rxbg5ysja.bkt.gdipper.com/Vernon_Dursley.png)
# Introduction
Vernon Dursley was an English Muggle, husband of Petunia Evans, father of Dudley Dursley and uncle by marriage of Harry Potter. He lived at 4 Privet Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey, along with his wife and son for twenty years until they were forced into hiding during the escalation of the Second Wizarding War. 

After Petunia's sister Lily and brother-in-law, James Potter, were killed by Voldemort in their own home, Petunia remained the sole surviving blood relative of Harry's. Both Wizard and Muggle law demanded that Petunia and Vernon be the new legal guardians of Harry Potter, which they accepted (albeit reluctantly). However, they disliked Harry and treated him badly, while spoiling and pampering Dudley.

When Harry was sent a letter from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Vernon got very angry, as he detested anything to do with magic. He was a former student of Smeltings Academy and a director of the Grunnings drill manufacturing company. In 1997, Vernon, Petunia and Dudley left their house in order to be hidden from Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters.

After the Second Wizarding War, Vernon had at least two grandchildren through Dudley and his wife. Through the union of Harry Potter and Ginevra Weasley, Vernon had two great-nephews, James Potter II and Albus Potter, as well as a great-niece, Lily Potter.
