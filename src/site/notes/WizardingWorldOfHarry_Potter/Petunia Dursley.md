# Introduction
Petunia Dursley (née Evans) (pre 1960 – pre 2020) was an English Muggle woman, the elder daughter of Mr and Mrs Evans and the older sister of the Muggle-born witch Lily Potter. During her childhood, she became resentful of her sister for being a witch, broke off contact with her sister and refused to have any contact with the wizarding world.

She married a Muggle, Vernon Dursley and they had a son, Dudley. However, when Lily was murdered by Voldemort, Petunia became guardian of her nephew, Harry Potter, who was only an infant then. She neglected and treated him cruelly for the most part (mainly due to her aversion to the Potters being wizards), and confined him to sleep in the cupboard under the stairs (although she allowed him a room of his own after receiving his acceptance letters to Hogwarts in order to attempt to trick Hogwarts into not sending letters).  

In 1991, when Rubeus Hagrid came and said that Harry would go to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, she became very angry at the fact her nephew had discovered his true magical heritage. She and her family left their home in 1997 in order to be protected from Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters. 

After the Second Wizarding War, her son married and she had two grandchildren. Through her nephew's marriage to Ginny Weasley, she had two great-nephews, James Sirius and Albus Severus Potter, the former named after her late brother-in-law, and a great-niece, Lily Luna Potter, named after her late sister.

She died sometime before 2020, although the cause of death and when exactly she died was unknown.
