# Introduction
Professor Pomona Sprout (b. 15 May) was a witch who worked as Head of Hufflepuff House and Head of the Herbology department at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. She attended the school in her youth, where she was Sorted into Hufflepuff and excelled at Herbology. Some time after her graduation, Sprout returned to Hogwarts to teach.

In 1993, Professor Sprout grew the Mandrakes that would later be used in the Mandrake Restorative Draught to cure those who were petrified by Slytherin's Monster. She also opposed Dolores Umbridge and her tyranny over the school in the 1995â€“1996 school year, which the rest of the staff were happy to join her in doing.

Sprout opposed Lord Voldemort during the Second Wizarding War. She voted for the school to remain open after the Battle of the Astronomy Tower, and assisted in ousting Severus Snape in 1998. She later took a group of students to the battlements during the Battle of Hogwarts and threw Devil's Snare and various other dangerous plants onto the invading Death Eaters.

She ultimately survived the war. By the early 21st century, Neville Longbottom taught Herbology, alongside her. By summer 2020, Professor Sprout had formally retired from her position as professor of Herbology.# Related Character
