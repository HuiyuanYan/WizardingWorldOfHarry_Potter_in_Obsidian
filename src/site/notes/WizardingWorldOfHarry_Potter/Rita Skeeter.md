# Introduction
Rita Skeeter (b. 1951) was a British witch and journalist who specialised in writing poison-pen stories. These stories tended to be based on false information and misreported interviews. She wrote articles for the Daily Prophet, as well as a few 'tell-all' biographies. Skeeter preferred writing for the sake of publicity and wrote what she thought people would "like to read" and what was lies rather than what they "ought to read" and which was the truth.

Albus Dumbledore in particular described her writing as "enchantingly nasty" after she wrote an unfavourable article about him.

Notable stories Rita covered include the trials of various Death Eaters after the First Wizarding War, the Triwizard Tournament, and (albeit reluctantly) Harry Potter's account of Lord Voldemort's return to power in 1995 for The Quibbler. She also wrote biographies of Armando Dippet, Albus Dumbledore, Severus Snape, and Harry Potter.

Rita's writing tended to be sensationalist and sometimes outright dishonest, paralleling her beliefs about writing what people "like to read". Her biography of Harry Potter, for instance, was described as being only one-quarter factual with the remaining three-quarters being pure fabrication and general dislike for Harry Potter being made into fake stories. Her ability to acquire information was assisted by her status as an unregistered beetle Animagus.
