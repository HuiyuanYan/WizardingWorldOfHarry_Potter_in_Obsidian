# Introduction
Alastor "Mad-Eye" Moody (d. 27 July 1997) was a pure-blood wizard, considered to be the most famous Auror of all time. He was a pivotal member of the Order of the Phoenix during the First and Second Wizarding Wars. Moody served with distinction during the first conflict, gaining a reputation as a skilful battler against the Dark Arts and sacrificing an eye, a leg, and part of his nose during the conflict.

As an Auror, he played a role in the imprisonment of many of the inhabitants of Azkaban. According to Ron Weasley "half the cells in Azkaban are full because of him". This activity led to his gaining many enemies and resulted in his becoming overly-cautious and paranoid about his security later in life.

In 1994, he agreed to Albus Dumbledore's request to become the new Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor at Hogwarts; however, he was kidnapped just prior to taking up the position by Barty Crouch Jnr, who subsequently disguised himself as Moody as part of a plan to kidnap Harry Potter on the instructions of Lord Voldemort.

Following his rescue from Barty Crouch Jnr, Moody joined the second Order of the Phoenix and fought in a number of the Second Wizarding War's battles, including the Battle of the Department of Mysteries in 1996 and the Battle of the Seven Potters in 1997, dying during the latter.

His magical eye was later used by Dolores Umbridge to spy on her subordinates in the Muggle-Born Registration Commission. It was later retrieved by Harry Potter when he infiltrated the Ministry of Magic in 1997, and was given a proper burial by Harry in the forest close to the location where the 422nd Quidditch World Cup had been held three years prior.
