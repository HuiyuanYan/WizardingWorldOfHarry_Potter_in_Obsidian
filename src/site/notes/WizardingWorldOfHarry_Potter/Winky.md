# Introduction
Winky (fl. 1981â€“2011) was a freed female house-elf who neither wanted freedom nor took to being a free elf. She was employed at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry when released from the Crouch family where for years, Winky had been devoted to Barty Crouch Snr. The elder Barty Crouch sacked Winky when she was found holding a wand in suspicious circumstances, which not only publicly associated him with dark magic, but demonstrated that her guardianship of his son might be unreliable.

After being freed, Winky fell into a depression from thinking she failed to service Barty Crouch, and began drinking heavily. At one point, Dobby got Winky a job at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where she for the second time met Harry Potter. On 2 May 1998, Winky participated in the Battle of Hogwarts, led by Kreacher into battle against the Death Eaters.
