# Introduction
Colin Creevey (1981 â€“ 2 May 1998) was a Muggle-born wizard, son of Mr Creevey and Mrs Creevey, and older brother of Dennis. He was a big fan of the famous Harry Potter, who was a year ahead of him in school.

During his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, he was sorted into Gryffindor House. He was known for taking several pictures of Harry and other students. During his fourth year, he and Dennis became members of Dumbledore's Army, an organisation taught and led by Harry Potter.  

Colin was expelled from Hogwarts in his sixth year, due to Voldemort's policy of not allowing Muggle-borns to attend the school. On 2 May 1998, he snuck into the Room of Requirement with the rest of Dumbledore's Army and fought in the Battle of Hogwarts, during which he was murdered by the Death Eaters.
