# Introduction
Fang (b. circa 1984) was an over-sized boarhound dog, and one of Rubeus Hagrid's pets. He was a large dog that lived in his hut with him and accompanied Hagrid in many places, such as the Forbidden Forest. Fang was present for the majority of the Second Wizarding War, such as the Battle of the Astronomy Tower and the Battle of Hogwarts. He survived the war and was still alive and well in the late 2000s.
