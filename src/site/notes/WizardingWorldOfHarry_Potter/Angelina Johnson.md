# Introduction
Angelina Weasley (née Johnson) (b. 24–30 October 1977) was a witch and a Gryffindor student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. She was also a member of Dumbledore's Army, an organisation taught and led by Harry Potter. She was also the captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team in her seventh year, which was also Harry's fifth year.

In 1998, two years after she had left school, she returned and fought in the Battle of Hogwarts against the Dark wizard Lord Voldemort and his followers. Sometime after the end of the Second Wizarding War, she married George Weasley, and the couple had two children, Fred II and Roxanne Weasley.
