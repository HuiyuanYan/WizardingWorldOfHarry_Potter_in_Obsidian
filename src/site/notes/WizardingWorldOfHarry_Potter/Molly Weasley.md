# Introduction
Molly Weasley (n√©e Prewett) (b. 30 October 1949 or 1950) was an English pure-blood witch and matriarch of the Weasley family after marrying Arthur Weasley. She was born into the Prewett family and was sister to Fabian and Gideon Prewett, members of the original Order of the Phoenix. 

Molly attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and was sorted into Gryffindor House. Sometime after she graduated, both her brothers were murdered by Death Eaters in the First Wizarding War. Molly and Arthur ended up having seven children, consisting of six sons named Bill, Charlie, Percy, Fred, George and Ron and only one daughter named Ginny Weasley. She also played a large part in the life of the famous Harry Potter, acting as a motherly figure towards him. 

Molly was a member of the revived Order of the Phoenix following the return of Lord Voldemort and participated in the final battle of the Second Wizarding War. Her actions during this battle caused her to be known as the witch that defeated and killed the notorious Death Eater Bellatrix Lestrange.

Molly survived the final battle to see her family expand even further. By 2017, she had twelve granchildren: Victoire Weasley, Dominique Weasley, Louis Weasley, Molly Weasley II, Lucy Weasley, Fred Weasley II, Roxanne Weasley, Rose Granger-Weasley, Hugo Granger-Weasley, James Sirius Potter, Albus Severus Potter, and Lily Luna Potter.
