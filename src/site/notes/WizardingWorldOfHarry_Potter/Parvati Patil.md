# Introduction
Parvati Patil (b. 1979/1980), was a witch of Indian heritage, daughter of Mr and Mrs Patil, and the identical twin sister of Padma. She was sorted into Gryffindor at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, but her sister Padma was sorted into Ravenclaw.  

Parvati became best friends with Lavender Brown, with whom she shared many interests, such as a love for Divination. Parvati attended the Yule Ball with Harry Potter in 1994, and a year later, she joined Dumbledore's Army, an organisation taught and led by Harry Potter. 

During her seventh year in 1998, she continued her studies at Hogwarts, when it was under the control of Lord Voldemort and the same year Parvati fought at the Battle of Hogwarts against Voldemort and his Death Eaters. It can be assumed that she survived the battle, as her name was not listed among the Fallen Fifty. If she did survive, what she did in her later life is unknown.
