# Introduction
Fred Weasley I (1 April 1978 – 2 May 1998) was an English pure-blood wizard, was the fourth son and the middle child, the most daring and dominant among the twins of Arthur Weasley and Molly Weasley (née Prewett), younger brother to Bill, Charlie and Percy, older twin brother and best friend to George Weasley, and older brother of Ron and Ginny Potter (née Weasley). Fred's first few years were marked by the height of the First Wizarding War and when Lord Voldemort fell for the first time. 

He attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry from 1989 to 1996 and was sorted into Gryffindor House. Both he and his twin brother were popular students, known for their sense of humour, pranks, inventions and the fact that they were Beaters for the Gryffindor Quidditch team. In their first year, they joined the Circle of Khanna, an organisation dedicated to avenging Rowan Khanna's death and bringing down R. In their seventh year, they joined Dumbledore's Army, an organisation taught and led by Harry Potter.

A born prankster and inventor, Fred left Hogwarts shortly prior to graduation to become a successful entrepreneur, alongside his twin brother, George, and opened the joke shop Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes at 93 Diagon Alley. Fred was also a member of the Order of the Phoenix; he fought in the Battle of the Seven Potters (1997) and was a commentator for Potterwatch during the height of the Second Wizarding War. 

Fred participated in the Battle of Hogwarts (1998), defending the castle's passageways with his twin. While fighting alongside his brother, Percy, he was killed in an explosion caused by an unknown Death Eater. His brother George named his son in honour of him.
