# Introduction
Seamus Finnigan (b. c. 1980) was an Irish half-blood wizard, son of Muggle Mr Finnigan and Irish witch Mrs Finnigan. Mr Finnigan did not learn this until after they were married and it gave him a "nasty shock" when he first learned it.

Seamus was a Gryffindor student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He was also the best friend of Dean Thomas. Seamus originally doubted Harry Potter's claim that Lord Voldemort had returned in 1995 (as his mother doubted it). However, late in 1995 he eventually joined Dumbledore's Army. The D.A. was an organisation taught and led by Harry Potter. Seamus joined after apologising to Harry.

In 1997 he continued his seventh year of education at Hogwarts, although the school was under the control of Voldemort. Seamus remained in the D.A. and fought bravely in the Battle of Hogwarts. It is currently unknown what he did after the Second Wizarding War.
