# Introduction
Penelope 'Penny' Clearwater (born c. 1975 or 1976) was a witch and Ravenclaw student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry from 1987 to 1994. In her later school years, she was a Prefect, and eventually started dating Percy Weasley, a Gryffindor student and a fellow Prefect.

After she finished her education at Hogwarts, Penelope and Percy never married. It can be assumed that they broke up at some point. Percy married another woman named Audrey Weasley instead.# Related Character
