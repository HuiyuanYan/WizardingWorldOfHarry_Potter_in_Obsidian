# Introduction
Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington, known after his death as Nearly Headless Nick (d. 31 October 1492), was a wizard who attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and was Sorted into Gryffindor House. 

He was a wizard of the royal court as an adult. He was executed by an improper decapitation, after he had a magical mishap with Lady Grieve. He tried to straighten her teeth but it backfired and she grew tusks. Since then, he became the resident ghost of Gryffindor Tower at the Hogwarts Castle.
