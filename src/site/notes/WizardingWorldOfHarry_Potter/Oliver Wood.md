# Introduction
Oliver Wood (born c. 1975 or 1976) was a wizard who was the Keeper and Captain for the Gryffindor Quidditch team during his time as a student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, which he attended from 1987 to 1994. 

Oliver was known for his determination and skill on the playing field, and his long lectures before practices. He led the Gryffindor team to victory in the Quidditch Cup in his seventh year.

After leaving school, Oliver joined Puddlemere United as a reserve player (presumably as Keeper). In 1998, Oliver returned to Hogwarts to fight in the Battle of Hogwarts against Voldemort and his Death Eaters, alongside his former school friends and teammates.
