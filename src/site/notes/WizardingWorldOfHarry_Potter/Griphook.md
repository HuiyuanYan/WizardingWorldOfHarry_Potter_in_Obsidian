# Introduction
Griphook (d. 1 May 1998) was a goblin who worked at Gringotts Wizarding Bank in Diagon Alley. He would later go on the run during the height of the Second Wizarding War following the fall of the Ministry of Magic and the raise of Lord Voldemort's new regime. He would later assist Harry Potter in his break-in of Gringotts in order to obtain Helga Hufflepuff's Cup.

However, despite being rescued by them, Griphook's general mistrust of wizardkind resulted in him betraying Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger. He betrayed them because he believed they would not hand him the Sword of Gryffindor, after destroying the Cup and other Horcruxes.

This act of betrayal eventually resulted in his own downfall. The goblins reported the Cup's theft to Voldemort, who subsequently slaughtered all of them with the Killing Curse in a fit of rage.
