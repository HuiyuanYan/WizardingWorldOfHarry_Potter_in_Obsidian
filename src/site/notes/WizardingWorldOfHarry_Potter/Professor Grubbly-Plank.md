# Introduction
Professor Wilhelmina Grubbly-Plank was a witch who worked as a substitute Care of Magical Creatures teacher at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.  She was first met by Harry Potter's batch in 1994, taking over lessons when Professor Rubeus Hagrid was unable to teach. She taught the class again in part of the next school year when Hagrid was away on a mission for Albus Dumbledore.
