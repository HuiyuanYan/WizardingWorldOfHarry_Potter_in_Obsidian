# Introduction
Dean Thomas (b. c. 1980) was an English half-blood wizard, the son of a wizard and a Muggle mother. When Dean Thomas was very young, his father died and his mother married another man, giving Dean several half-siblings. Since Dean's father never told his mother that he was a wizard and was eventually murdered by Death Eaters when he refused to join them, Dean grew up thinking he was Muggle-born.

Dean was a Gryffindor student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He was in the same year as the famous Harry Potter and played as a Chaser for his house's Quidditch team for a time. In his fifth year, he joined Dumbledore's Army, an organisation taught and led by Harry Potter. Dean (although a half-blood) could not prove that he had any wizarding heritage and was therefore in danger when Lord Voldemort took control of the Ministry of Magic in 1997. 

Dean was forced to go on the run to avoid arrest and imprisonment by the Muggle-Born Registration Commission, missing his seventh year of schooling. He was eventually captured by Snatchers, but escaped Malfoy Manor along with several other prisoners and soon returned to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to participate in the Battle of Hogwarts.

Dean survived the Second Wizarding War and was seen after the final battle sitting next to Seamus Finnigan and Aberforth Dumbledore in the Great Hall. His later life however, remains unknown.
