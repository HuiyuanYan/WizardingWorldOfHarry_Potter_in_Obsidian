# Introduction
Salazar Slytherin (fl. c. 993) was a pure-blood wizard, noted for his cunning and determination. He was regarded as one of the greatest wizards of the age, regarded for his abilities as a Parselmouth and as a skilled Legilimens. Slytherin was one of the four founders of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry along with Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, and Rowena Ravenclaw. He was also the namesake of Slytherin House.

He mistrusted Muggle-born students to the point of proposing that they should not be accepted at Hogwarts. When he expressed his opinion to the other Hogwarts founders, they did not agree with him. In response, he left the school, never to return, and constructed the Chamber of Secrets to house a Basilisk, so that one day, the Heir of Slytherin could purge the school of Muggle-borns in his name.
