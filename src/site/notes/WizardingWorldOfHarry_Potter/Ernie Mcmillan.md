# Introduction
Ernest "Ernie" Macmillan (b. 1980) was a pure-blood wizard who attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry from 1991-1998. He was in the same year as the famous Harry Potter and was sorted into Hufflepuff House. He was also born into the Macmillan family, one of the Sacred Twenty-Eight.

Ernie was an academically strong student and good friends with Hannah Abbott and Justin Finch-Fletchley. In 1992, Ernie initially suspected that Harry Potter was the Heir of Slytherin during the opening of the Chamber of Secrets in his second year. However after Hermione Granger was petrified he told Harry that he knew Harry would never do that to her. After he apologised to Harry for his suspicions and accusations, the two became good friends.

In Ernie's fourth year, their friendship temporarily wavered after Harry's name came out of the Goblet of Fire after Hufflepuff's Cedric Diggory. He thought Harry cheated and proceeded to wear Potter Stinks badges, courtesy of Draco Malfoy. When Harry proclaimed that Voldemort had Returned at the end of the year Ernie was one of the few who believed him.

In his fifth year, Ernie became a member of Dumbledore's Army, an organisation taught and led by Harry for the purposes of learning practical defensive magic. He joined the D.A. again when it was reinstated during his seventh year, opposing Death Eater control of Hogwarts and fighting in the Battle of Hogwarts on the 2 May 1998.

It remains unknown what happened to Ernie after the Second Wizarding War, but he likely survived as his name wasn't listed among the casualties. What Ernie did after the war, if he survived, is unknown.# Related Character
