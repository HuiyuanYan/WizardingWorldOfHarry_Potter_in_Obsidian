# Introduction
Padma Patil (b. c. 1980) was a British witch of Indian heritage who was in the same year as Harry Potter at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. She was the identical twin sister of Parvati Patil. Padma was sorted into Ravenclaw house, although her identical twin was sorted into Gryffindor, and became a prefect in her fifth year. She was also a member of Dumbledore's Army, an organisation taught and led by Harry Potter.

She later fought in the Battle of Hogwarts in 1998. Padma survived the final battle of the Second Wizarding War and graduated from school. She was most likely present for Harry Potter's final defeat of Lord Voldemort.
