# Introduction
When Albus Dumbledore began to take action to stop Gellert Grindelwald, Nicolas Flamel, as his friend, decided to help him in this, and agreed to let him use his home as a safehouse for any potential allies should the situation require it, and gave him a card leading to the home. Albus gave Newton Scamander the card as Albus was unable to participate in the fight.

In 1927, the Magizoologist Newton Scamander decided to take advantage of the invitation and arrived at the Flamel House alongside two Americans by the name of Porpentina Goldstein and Jacob Kowalski, as well as Yusuf Kama. The three were attempting to track down Credence Barebone, a young wizard important to Grindelwald's plans, though for different reasons. 

Kama, who was attempting to assassinate Barebone, had tried to take Newt and his friends captive in his sewers, allowing him to track down his target unhindered. However, he had suddenly lost consciousness due to his exposure to the Water dragon parasite venom. 

Once they had arrived safely at the Flamel House, which was by then well protected by various Protective enchantments, Scamander was able to remove the Water dragon parasite from Kama's eye. Soon after, while Yusuf recovered from the procedure. Newt and Tina travelled to the French Ministry of Magic to retrieve the Lestrange family tree box.
