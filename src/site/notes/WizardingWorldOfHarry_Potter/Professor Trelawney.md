# Introduction
Professor Sybill Patricia Trelawney (b. 9 March pre-1962) was a half-blood witch and professor of Divination at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. She is the great-great-granddaughter of the celebrated Cassandra Trelawney, who was also a Seer.

It was Trelawney herself who made the prophecy concerning Lord Voldemort and the one with the power to vanquish him (Voldemort took this to mean Harry Potter) during her job interview with Albus Dumbledore. At the end of the 1993–1994 school year, she accurately predicted the escape of Peter Pettigrew and the return of Lord Voldemort.

In the 1995–1996 school year, Trelawney was greatly distressed by Dolores Umbridge, who dismissed her and attempted to banish her from Hogwarts Castle, though Dumbledore allowed her to remain at the school, with Umbridge being greatly offended when she later had to teach alongside the centaur Firenze. In the 1997–1998 school year, she participated in the Battle of Hogwarts, dropping crystal balls on Death Eaters' heads and tending to the wounded and dead along with Padma Patil.

Professor Trelawney continued to teach well into the 2010s, continuing her tradition of predicting the deaths of her students. Although Firenze was welcomed back to his herd, the two continued to share the post of Divination professor.# Related Character
