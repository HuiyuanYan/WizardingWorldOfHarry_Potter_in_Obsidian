# Introduction
George Weasley (b. 1 April 1978) was an English pure-blood wizard, the fifth son and the less dominant among the twins of Arthur Weasley and Molly Weasley (n√©e Prewett), younger brother of Bill, Charlie and Percy, younger twin brother and best friend of the late Fred Weasley, and older brother to Ron and Ginny. George's first few years were marked by the height of the First Wizarding War and Lord Voldemort's first fall.

He attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry from 1989 to 1996 with Fred, and was sorted into Gryffindor House. He and Fred were popular students, joining the Circle of Khanna in their first year, becoming Beaters for the Gryffindor Quidditch team in their second year and members of Dumbledore's Army in their unfinished seventh year. 

A born prankster and inventor, George left Hogwarts prior to graduation to become a successful entrepreneur with Fred, and opened the joke shop Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes at 93 Diagon Alley. He was a member of the Order of the Phoenix and fought in the Battle of the Seven Potters and the Battle of Hogwarts; in the latter, Fred died, leaving George devastated.

Sometime after the end of the Second Wizarding War, George married Angelina Johnson, with whom he had a son named Fred in honour of his late twin, and a daughter named Roxanne. He and his brother Ron also turned Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes into a huge money spinner.
