# Introduction
Buckbeak, later renamed Witherwings, was a male hippogriff. He lived with Rubeus Hagrid during Harry Potter's third year at Hogwarts, along with a few other hippogriffs.

He was later unfairly sentenced to death, when he attacked Draco Malfoy after being taunted and provoked. Buckbeak's death sentence was delivered from the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures. Many of the members of this committee had been threatened by Draco's father, Lucius Malfoy, into voting for that verdict.

With the help of Harry Potter, Hermione Granger and her Time-Turner, Buckbeak escaped execution in 1994 and he came under the care of Sirius Black. Sirius kept Buckbeak with him while on the run during the 1994â€“1995 school year, and later kept him in his mother's bedroom while in hiding at 12 Grimmauld Place.

After Sirius's death, Buckbeak came to be owned by Harry Potter through Sirius's will, though Harry allowed him to live with Hagrid. He participated in two battles of the Second Wizarding War, most notably the Battle of Hogwarts. He also showed great affection and loyalty toward Harry, defending him whenever he was in danger.
