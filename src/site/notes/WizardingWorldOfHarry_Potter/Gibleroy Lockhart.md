# Introduction
Professor Gilderoy Lockhart, O.M. (Third Class) (b. 26 January 1964) was a half-blood wizard, a Ravenclaw student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and later a famous wizarding celebrity who authored many books on dark creatures and his supposed encounters with them.

Prior to his tenure as Professor of Defence Against the Dark Arts at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, specifically during the 1992â€“1993 school year, he received many prestigious awards, such as Order of Merlin, Third Class; Honorary Member of the Dark Force Defence League; and the Witch Weekly's Most Charming Smile Award five times in a row. He invented an Occamy egg yolk shampoo at some point. This shampoo, however, was too dangerous and expensive for open market; it subsequently became his dream to be able to market and sell the product. His favourite colour was lilac.

Lockhart claimed he did many heroic acts, but it was later found out that he did not actually do them. He instead used his considerable talent in Memory Charms to force the actual people who had done them into forgetting what they did, while he took credit for the acts. Ironically, Lockhart lost all of his memory on 29 May 1993 due to a backfired Memory Charm cast by Ron Weasley's damaged wand.

Lockhart then became a permanent resident of St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries. He was institutionalised in the same ward as Neville Longbottom's parents (the Janus Thickey Ward for permanent spell damage). Following his hospitalisation, he dictated his final book entitled Who Am I?.# Related Character
